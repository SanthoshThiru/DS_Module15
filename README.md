# DS_Module15: TREE DATA STRUCTURE

This repository explores various aspects and applications of the Tree data structure, with implementations primarily in C.

## Experiments

Each experiment focuses on a distinct tree concept or application, including source code and supporting documentation.

* **Ex11: Tree Representation and Traversal**
    * Covers different ways to represent trees and fundamental traversal algorithms (e.g., inorder, preorder, postorder).
    * *Files:* `Ex11-Tree-Representation-and-Traversal.md`, `tree_representation_traversal.png`

* **Ex12: Binary Search Tree**
    * Implementation and operations of a Binary Search Tree (BST).
    * *Files:* `Ex12-Binary-Search-Tree.md`, `binary_search_tree.png`

* **Ex13: Expression Tree**
    * Builds and evaluates expression trees from mathematical expressions.
    * *Files:* `Ex13-Expression-tree.md`, `expression_tree.png`

* **Ex14: Heap Tree**
    * Focuses on the Heap data structure (Max-Heap/Min-Heap) and its operations.
    * *Files:* `Ex14-Heap-Tree.md`, `heap_tree.png`

* **Ex15: Largest Element in BST**
    * Algorithm to efficiently find the largest element within a Binary Search Tree.
    * *Files:* `Ex15-Largest Element in BST.md`, `image.png` (assuming this is related to the output/concept)
